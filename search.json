Looking output, see now completed second three steps towards data harmonization! move , let us take quick look object ql_harmonize created: see object contains several components. Usually, need deal level details just want harmonize data. Nonetheless, two components important understanding ql_harmonize done. Firstly, ql_harmonize goes every single connection found ql_prepare. stored attribute connections_rec_tbl within object created ql_harmonize. look one connection (.e., one row connections_rec_tbl ): words, 1610 rows connection overview contains details connection (e.g., questions type connection) importantly: recoding table harmonize two instruments. However, want one robust recoding table instrument pair (“” “B”) directions (“” -> “B” & “B” -> “”). end, ql_harmonize condenses 1610 . Specifically, QuestionLink chooses median equivalent score across harmonization solutions given instrument pair direction (e.g., “” -> “B”). example, 97 connections can harmonize “source” question “” towards format “target” question “B”. However, condensed exactly one recoding table attribute summarized_rec_tbl: practice, however, need delve manually QuestionLink objects. Instead, can easily apply recoding tables next function: ql_transform.","code":"harmonization_solution <- prepared_connections |>    ql_harmonize() harmonization_solution |> str(max.level = 1) ##  'questionlink' chr \"questionlink_object\" ##  - attr(*, \"connections_rec_tbl\")= tibble [1,610 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ##  - attr(*, \"summarized_rec_tbl\")= tibble [100 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ##  - attr(*, \"data\")= tibble [92,000 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ##  - attr(*, \"population_flag\")= logi FALSE ##  - attr(*, \"weight_flag\")= logi FALSE ##  - attr(*, \"scale_min_max\")= list() n_connections <- harmonization_solution |>    attr(\"connections_rec_tbl\") |>    nrow()  harmonization_solution |>    attr(\"connections_rec_tbl\") |>    head(1) |>    t() |>    format_table() n_connections_A_B <- harmonization_solution |>    attr(\"connections_rec_tbl\") |>    filter(     source_question == \"A\",     target_question == \"B\"   ) |>    nrow() harmonization_solution |>    attr(\"summarized_rec_tbl\") |>    filter(     source_question == \"A\",     target_question == \"B\"   ) |>   format_table()"},{"path":"https://matroth.github.io/questionlink/articles/questionlink_tutorial.html","id":"ql_transform-recoding-the-response-data","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"04 QuestionLink step by step","what":"ql_transform Recoding the response data","title":"QuestionLink Tutorial","text":"ql_transform can recode data along equating solutions QuestionLink found. process requires us make two decisions: (1) question want harmonize towards (2) data want harmonize?","code":""},{"path":"https://matroth.github.io/questionlink/articles/questionlink_tutorial.html","id":"which-question-to-harmonize-towards","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"04 QuestionLink step by step > ql_transform Recoding the response data","what":"1.
